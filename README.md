# Laon-Approval-Prediction

The increasing demand for personal and business loans has 
necessitated the development of efficient and reliable systems for predicting loan approvals. 
Financial institutions aim to minimize risks while offering loans, making the accurate prediction 
of loan approvals critical. This project focuses on building a predictive model using Logistic 
Regression, a widely used classification algorithm, to predict whether a loan application will be 
approved based on applicant data.
